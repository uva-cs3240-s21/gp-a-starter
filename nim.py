# This program plays the game of Nim.

# - The game of Nim is a two player game - this version is player vs. computer.
# - There is one pile of marbles which the players take turns taking marbles from.
# - A player must take at least one marble per turn. 
# - However, a player can take more if they choose (up to half the pile).
# - Whoever takes the last marble, loses.
